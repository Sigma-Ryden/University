Scikit-learn is a free software machine learning library for the Python programming language.
The library implements the following main methods:
Linear: models, the task is to construct a separating (for classification) or 
approximating (for regression) hyperplane.
Metric: models that calculate the distance using one of the metrics between the objects in the sample,
and make decisions based on this distance (nearest neighbors).
Decision trees: training models based on a set of conditions that are optimally selected to solve a problem.

This project, developed by David Cournapeau, was published in the Google Summer of Code program
and was released in 2010. Since its creation, the library has transformed into an infrastructure with 
ample opportunities to create machine learning models. New features allow you to solve even more problems 
and increase usability. In this article, I will talk about the ten most interesting features that you may 
not know about.

Classification is the process of predicting the class of given data points. 
Classes are sometimes called as targets/ labels or categories. 
Classification predictive modeling is the task of approximating a mapping function 
(f) from input variables (X) to discrete output variables (y).
5 slide==============================
Regression is a statistical method used in finance, investing, and other disciplines that 
attempts to determine the strength and character of the relationship between one dependent 
variable (usually denoted by Y) and a series of other variables (known as independent variables).

Regression helps investment and financial managers to value assets and understand the relationships
between variables, such as commodity prices and the stocks of businesses dealing in those commodities.

Clustering is the task of dividing the population or data points into a number of groups
such that data points in the same groups are more similar to other data points in the same group 
than those in other groups. In simple words, the aim is to segregate groups with similar traits 
and assign them into clusters.
7 slide==============================
Dimensionality reduction, or dimension reduction, is the transformation of data from a high-dimensional 
space into a low-dimensional space so that the low-dimensional representation retains some meaningful 
properties of the original data, ideally close to its intrinsic dimension.
Dimensionality reduction is common in fields that deal with large numbers of observations and/or large numbers 
of variables, such as signal processing, speech recognition, neuroinformatics, and bioinformatics.

Model selection is the task of selecting a statistical model from a set of candidate models, given data. 
In the simplest cases, a pre-existing set of data is considered. However, the task can also involve the 
design of experiments such that the data collected is well-suited to the problem of model selection. 
Given candidate models of similar predictive or explanatory power, the simplest model is most likely
 to be the best choice
9 slide==============================
Data preprocessing is an integral part of machine learning, 
since the quality of the data and the useful information that
 can be extracted from it directly affects the ability of our model to learn;
 therefore, it is extremely important that we preprocess our data before entering it into our model.
